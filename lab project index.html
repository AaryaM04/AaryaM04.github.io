            <p>
                Hello! I’m Aarya Mallik, a passionate second-year B.Tech student eager to explore the world of technology and innovation. I have a keen interest in software development, data science, and artificial intelligence. My journey so far has equipped me with the foundational skills in programming and problem-solving, and I’m excited to take on more challenging projects that allow me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. In my free time, I enjoy reading tech blogs, experimenting with coding projects, and collaborating with peers on exciting ideas. I believe that continuous learning is the key to success in this ever-evolving field.
